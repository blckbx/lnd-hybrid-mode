How to set up hybrid mode on LND

Proposed Agenda: 

- Caution clearnet! (security, exposure)
- Pros and Cons of hybrid mode, esp. clearnet exposure
  - Availability despite Tor issues
  - therefore higher uptime
  - 
- Configuring LND.conf: nat/upnp, externalip
- Static VS Dynamic IPs
- Solution: DNS configuration: 
  - acquiring dyndns
  - externalhosts
  - NANN IP resolution
  - IP advertisement on platforms (Amboss, LN+, cheeserobot)
-
