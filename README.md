How to set up hybrid mode on LND

Proposed Agenda: 

- Caution clearnet! (security, exposure)
- Pros and Cons of hybrid mode, esp. clearnet exposure
- Configuring LND.conf: nat/upnp, externalip
- Static / Dynamic IPs
- Solution: DNS configuration: acquiring dyndns, externalhosts, NANN IP resolution, IP advertisement on platforms (Amboss, LN+, cheeserobot)
